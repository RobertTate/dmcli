# DMCLI - A CLI for Organizing your DM Notes.

DMCLI is a command line interface that I'm working on to make it easier for me to organize my DND notes as a dungeon master. Making it also helped me ingest the content from the Lost Mines of Phandelver campaign, because I had to make little JSON files for all the different content. 

### TO DO's:

- I still also need/want to get it set up as a CLI you can download and use globally from npm.
- I want to add an initiative tracker feature
- I want to add a way to add / edit content without having to edit json files directly.
