DMCLI is a command line interface still under construction, that I made to make it easier for me to organize my DND notes as a dungeon master. Making it also helped me ingest the content from the Lost Mines of Phandelver campaign, because I had to make little JSON files for all the different content. 

The tool still doesn't have a way to add content other than by making these JSON files. I may later on add an edit/add content feature to make it smoother to both add content, and view the content.

I still also need/want to get it set up as a CLI you can download and use globally from npm.
