# Features

## Campaign Content
The primary function of DMCLI is to help you organize your campaign notes. You can get started with this process by selecting either `Create a New Campaign`, or `Open Campaigns Folder` from the main menu.

### Create a New Campaign 
Use this option if you'd rather use DMCLI to add / edit / remove campaign folders and content.
### Open Campaigns Folder
Use this option if you'd rather add / edit / remove campaign folders and content manually. There is a `README.md` file in the campaigns folder with additional information on how to do so.

----
## Roll Initiative!
You can find this option in the main menu, and also at the content level within your campaign. Selecting this option will start up an initiative tracker tool.

If you've preconfigured your campaign with players using the `Edit Campaign Config` option within your top level campaign folder, you have the option of adding those players to an encounter automatically.

----

## Search 5e Content
You can find this option in the main menu, and also at the content item level. Selecting `Search 5e Content` allows you to search through Dungeons and Dragons, 5th Edition content. Current selections include **classes, conditions, damage types, equipment, languages, magic items, magic schools, monsters, proficiencies, races,** and **spells**.
